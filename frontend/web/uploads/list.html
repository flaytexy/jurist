			<h1>Bring the World Into your Classroom</h1>
      <p>The Beautiful Nation Project  is a social networking experience for educators and students alike. When our journey begins, new opportunities for interactive story telling style content streaming to your classroom from our location at sea.  We believe in the power of natural curiosity when creating curriculum and the educators who are following will be tapped into something magnificent and modular, making all of our reports mixable and mashable. We may invent new words along the way, while promoting experiential learning. By definition, BNP is a geosocial network.  Our content and activity is all geo-related.  Everything and everyone are linked by their geographic location in the world. <br>

The network houses resources for educators and students. Articles, photos and videos produced by the Voyage of Makulu crew, along side real-time communication tools, maps, games and activities, offer ways for students to engage with the crew and each other in real-time, about real global issues. <br>
<br>
Articles are filtered into subject-specific sections of the network, called <a href="http://www.beautifulnationproject.org/channels">Channels</a>. By subscribing to a specific Channel, your classroom can engage in online discussions and videocalls with the crew and each other about content posted in the Channel. <br>
